# Shortcodes

This theme comes with shortcodes which allow you to create more customized post and page layouts with the help of columns, buttons, lists, etc.

Briefly, shortcode is a special tag that you can enter into a post that gets replaced with different content when actually viewing the post on the website. You can add the shortcodes from the WordPress visual editor. Navigate to a Post or a Page, and find the Shortcode Editor button in the post editor window.
